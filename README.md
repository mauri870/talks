# talks

This repository contains the slides and code for talks I have given at
various conferences and meetups.

The slides can be built using `golang.org/x/tools/present`:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present@latest
present
```

You can also find the slides online at https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/mauri870/talks/x.slide, where x is the name of the talk.
