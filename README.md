# talks

This repository contains the slides and code for talks I have given at
various conferences and meetups.

The slides can be built using `golang.org/x/tools/present`:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present@latest
cd _content && present
```

You can start a server running at `localhost:4000` where you can see the slides:

```bash
go run .
```

You can also find the slides online at https://talks.mauri870.com.
